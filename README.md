# PROTASKER

## Intro

> This project is the first final assignment of the Object-Oriented Programming course at [ProPTIT](https://proptit.com/).

Realize that the older you get, the more work you have to handle. That's why work management is so important.

This ProTasker application will give you the ability to take notes on tasks to do as well as check and edit them.
